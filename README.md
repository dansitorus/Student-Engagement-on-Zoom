Project Overview
In the realm of online education, student engagement is essential, especially as universities increasingly rely on virtual platforms like Zoom for instruction. To gauge and boost student involvement, many courses integrate a class participation score into the overall assessment. However, quantifying each student's engagement through their virtual interactions presents challenges.
This project seeks to tackle these challenges by leveraging auto-generated transcripts from Zoom sessions to determine each student's total speaking duration during class. By quantifying airtime in milliseconds, this study aims to provide a measurable indicator of student participation. This data will offer valuable insights to help educators refine engagement strategies and enhance the online
